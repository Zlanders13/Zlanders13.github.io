<h3>About Me </h3>
<p> My name is Zachary Landers. I am 22 years old.
  I am currently enrolled in Brooklyn College studying Physics. My passion lies within technology. My goal is to use
	technology to build a better tomorrow. Two fields that align with my goal are Renewable Energy and Medical Technology.
	I am very hard working and eager to learn. I enjoy working on projects whether it be as a group or individually.I graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School where I
  studied Software Engineering. After trying out coding I realized it is not my ideal career choice
  but I do appreciate the art of coding and find it to be a very practical skill. I love working with computers
  whether it be assembling them or troubleshooting software issues. Technology has always been a passion of mine
  I like working with my hands to either create or fix things.
